            Material Index undertakes pre-demolition, pre-refurbishment and
            pre-redevelopment audits using its digital platform. These audits
            are essential at all stages of a building's life cycle, especially
            before renovation or deconstruction. They play a vital role in
            understanding the components within a building and their fate during
            refurbishment or demolition.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Material Index makes audit analysis and reporting easier, but exists
            primarily to allow for more materials to be retained, reused or
            resold, lowering the embodied carbon footprint of the construction
            and real estate industry. Understanding what is in a building and
            determining what happens prior to works proceeding prevents a huge
            amount of materials being needlessly sent to waste.

          <h2 class="h3 fw-bold mb-4">What are pre-demolition audits?</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Pre-demolition and pre-refurbishment audits are surveys undertaken
            on existing buildings, precisely identifying the type and volume of
            materials that will arise as a result of deconstruction, and
            indicating the most environmentally sustainable ways of dealing with
            these materials according to the circular economy hierarchy. This
            means identifying which of the materials are remaining in place
            within a building, are being reused either within the scheme.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Material Index’s audits increase the amount of material reuse in
            projects, divert more waste from landfill, and capture more value
            from the materials arising from deconstruction. They are often
            undertaken by conscientious real estate developers and asset
            managers to reduce their environmental impact, particularly the
            embodied carbon in construction, to meet their Net Zero goals while
            lowering waste costs and recovering value.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Material Index audits are unique in that they do not just tabulate
            the amount of waste produced during deconstruction as material type
            (eg 4 tonnes of glass) but include a detailed ‘asset register’ of
            components more akin to the bill of materials produced in the
            construction phase (eg. 42 windows). All audits are produced using
            Material Index’s digital platform, which supports this component
            based approach to building analysis, but also facilitates easier and
            more collaborative working.

            Pre-redevelopment audits are typically undertaken at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/resources-landing-page/riba-plan-of-work">
                RIBA stages 1
            and 2</a>, prior to the completion of the full concept design and at
            pre-application planning stage. They are a ‘tool for understanding
            whether existing buildings, structures and materials can be
            retained, refurbished, or incorporated into the new development’ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/planning/implementing-london-plan/london-plan-guidance/circular-economy-statement-guidance">(CE
            statements 2022)</a>. A pre-redevelopment audit recognizes that within
            every structure there is embedded carbon, materials and energy and
            that efforts should be made to retain and recover this.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            They should be undertaken by an independent third-party and explore
            options for retaining existing structures and materials on the site,
            or their use by third parties. It is not always possible to achieve,
            but renovation of existing buildings should be considered prior to
            substantial demolition, and substantial demolition should be
            justified. Pre-redevelopment audits should include an overview of the
            existing structure, and targets for how the existing building
            elements can be recovered. These audits can be supplemented with a
            detailed breakdown of materials in the building included within the
            pre-demolition audit.

          <p class="mb-4">
            Material Index audits are granular and digital, breaking the

            maximum reuse and accurate environmental reporting. Materials are
            assigned a status according to the circular economy hierarchy. The
            audit involves a detailed visual inspection survey, supported by an
            analysis of existing records on the building. Material Index are
            digitally native, and can process dwg or Revit information, or from
            operations and maintenance manuals.
