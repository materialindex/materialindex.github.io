            Material Index undertakes pre-demolition audits, pre-refurbishment audits and pre-redevelopment audits using our digital platform. These audits and surveys can be undertaken at all stages of a site or building's life cycle, but typically take place prior to deconstruction or major refurbishment or redevelopment works.   Undertaking an audit with Material Index is the first step in understanding the life cycle of key products, components and construction materials within a building, site or portfolio.

          <p class="mb-4">
Material Index makes audit analysis and reporting easier, but exists primarily to promote circularity, allowing for more materials to be diverted from landfill through reuse on/off site, reclaim or recycling. The Material Index platform allows input from building and demolition contractors and project stakeholders to determine the circular economy pathway of materials during refurbishment, redevelopment and demolition aiming to lower the embodied carbon footprint of the construction and real estate industry.


          </p>

          <p>Material Index audits are unique in that they do not just tabulate the amount of waste produced during deconstruction as material type (eg 4 tonnes of glass) but include a detailed ‘asset register’ of components more akin to the bill of materials produced in the construction phase (eg. 42 windows). All audits are produced using Material Index’s digital platform, which supports this component based approach to building analysis using proprietary datasets, but also facilitates easier and more collaborative working.

          <p class="mb-4">
            In the UK, pre-redevelopment and pre-demolition audits are often required at the planning stage with Circular Economy Statements to meet sustainability policy and BREEAM requirements.  Material Index undertakes audits according to the BRE Pre-Redevelopment Waste Audit Code of Practice, using our proprietary platform allowing for all stakeholders, from owners, to designers, to building contractors to make effective use of the audit information.

          <p class="mb-4">
            Pre-demolition audits and pre-refurbishment audits are surveys undertaken on existing buildings, precisely identifying the type and volume of materials that will arise as a result of deconstruction, and indicating the most environmentally sustainable ways of dealing with these materials according to the circular economy hierarchy. This means identifying which of the materials are remaining in place within a building, are being reused either within the scheme.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Material Index’s audits can increase the amount of material reuse in projects, divert more waste from landfill, and capture more value from the materials arising from deconstruction. They are often undertaken by conscientious real estate developers and asset managers to reduce their environmental impact, particularly the embodied carbon in construction, to meet their Net Zero goals while lowering waste costs and recovering value.

          <p class="mb-4">
            Pre-redevelopment audits are typically undertaken at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/resources-landing-page/riba-plan-of-work">
                RIBA stages 1
            and 2</a>, prior to the completion of the full concept design and at
            pre-application planning stage. They are a ‘tool for understanding
            whether existing buildings, structures and materials can be
            retained, refurbished, or incorporated into the new development’ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/planning/implementing-london-plan/london-plan-guidance/circular-economy-statement-guidance">(CE
            statements 2022)</a>. A pre-redevelopment audit recognizes that within
            every structure there is embedded carbon, materials and energy and
            that efforts should be made to retain and recover this.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            A pre-redevelopment audit should be undertaken by an independent third-party and explore options for retaining existing structures and materials on the site, or their use by third parties. It is not always possible to achieve, but renovation of existing buildings should be considered prior to substantial demolition, and substantial demolition should be justified.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            Pre-redevelopment audits should include an overview of the existing structure, and targets for how the existing building elements can be recovered. These audits can be supplemented with a detailed breakdown of materials in the building included within the pre-demolition audit.

            Material Index audits are granular and digital, breaking the
            building down into its constituent components in order to facilitate
            maximum reuse and accurate environmental reporting. Materials are
            assigned a status according to the circular economy hierarchy. The
            audit involves a detailed visual inspection survey, supported by an
            analysis of existing records on the building. Material Index are
            digitally native, and can process dwg or Revit information, or from
            operations and maintenance manuals.

            Material passports are digital documents listing all materials in a
            building, supporting circular use and reversible design.

            Simply put, a material passport is a digital document listing all
            the materials and their properties that are included in a product or
            a building. The information listed supports a circular use of
            building materials, products and components whilst supporting
            reversible design.
